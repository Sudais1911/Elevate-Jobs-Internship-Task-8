1. What does a dashboard do?  
A dashboard visually displays key information and metrics in one place. It helps users quickly understand trends, patterns, and insights from data to support decision-making.

2. How do you choose the right chart?  
The right chart depends on the type of data and the story you want to tell:
- Line charts are great for showing trends over time.
- Bar charts compare categories (e.g., sales by region).
- Donut or pie charts show proportions (e.g., sales by category).
- Always prioritize clarity and avoid clutter.

3. What is a slicer/filter?  
A slicer (in Power BI) or filter allows users to dynamically interact with the dashboard. It helps narrow down data by specific criteria, like filtering sales by region or category, making the dashboard more user-friendly and focused.

4. Why do we use KPIs?  
KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) track performance against goals. They help monitor business health, identify opportunities or issues, and ensure teams stay aligned with strategic objectives.

5. What did your dashboard show about sales?  
The dashboard showed that:
- The West region had the highest overall sales.
- Technology was the top-performing category.
- June 2024 had the highest sales spike.
- Some regions and months performed below average, indicating areas for improvement.

6. How do you make a dashboard look clean?  
To keep a dashboard clean:
- Use consistent colors and spacing.
- Avoid too many charts on one page.
- Use clear titles and labels.
- Group related visuals and use white space effectively.
- Highlight key insights with formatting or tooltips.

7. Did you clean the data before starting?
